# Silvie, Discord Bot

Silvie is a Grand Archive fan-made Discord Bot which provides some useful chat commands.

## Commands

`/silvie` is the main command used to communicate with Silvie, ensuring no clashes with other bots.

Subcommands are the way to then request different things. These are phrases placed after the `/silvie` command, e.g. `/silvie help`.

Below are all of the commands Silvie supports:

### `search [set] [card]`

Reveal information about a given card in a given set.

- `set` - The name of a set (prompted by Discord);
- `card` - The full or partial name of a card within that set.

This displays full card text and attributes, along with an expandable image of the card (if present).
